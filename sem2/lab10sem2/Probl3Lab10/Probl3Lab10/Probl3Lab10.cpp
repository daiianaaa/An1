/*
 Horvath Daiana, E_2012
    Implement a class that has 2 protected integer variables, that contains a setter and getter
methods for each attribute. Write a second class that inherits the first defined class and
implements the elementary arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) applied on the variables mentioned
above the results being returned by methods. Write a third class derived from the second one
that implements the methods for calculating the square root of a number (mul result obtained
by the previous derived class) received as parameter, and for raising a numeric value to a
certain power (the base (plus, result obtained by the previous derived class) and the power
(minus, result obtained by the previous derived class) are sent to the method as parameters).
Verify the methodsâ€™s calling using objects at different hierchies levels.
