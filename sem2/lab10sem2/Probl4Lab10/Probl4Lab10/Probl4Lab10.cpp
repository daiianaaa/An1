/*
Horvath Daiana, E_2012
Define a class called Triangle with 3 attributes for the triangle sides that has
a method that calculates the perimeter of the triangle with the sides introduced
from the KB. Another class, Triangle_extended, is derived in public mode from
Triangle and defines a method for calculating the triangleâ€™s area. Using objects
from both classes call the allowed methods. Verify before to instantiate the
objects the possibility to define a Triangle object.
