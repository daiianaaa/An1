 Horvath Daiana, E_2012
 Write a C/C++ application that allocates the necessary amount of memory for storing 10.000 integer numbers. The program automatically initializes the numbers with random values between 1 and 100 (use the library functions srand() and/or rand() in VC++). Write a function that displays the most 10 frequently numbers and the number of their appearances in the initial array.
